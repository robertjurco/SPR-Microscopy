    # The Model-View-Controller (MVP) architecture separates an application into three components:
    # the Model, which handles data and business logic; the View, which manages the user interface and displays data;
    # and the Controller, which acts as an intermediary, processing user input, updating the Model, and refreshing the View.
    # This separation of concerns makes the codebase easier to manage, test, and maintain,
    # as each component can be developed independently. The Controller ensures that the View remains passive and
    # focused on UI tasks, while the Model remains unaware of the UI, leading to a more modular and maintainable
    # application structure.
