    # The Model-View-Presenter (MVP) architecture separates an application into three components:
    # the Model, which handles data and business logic; the View, which manages the user interface and displays data;
    # and the Presenter, which acts as an intermediary, processing user input, updating the Model, and refreshing the View.
    # This separation of concerns makes the codebase easier to manage, test, and maintain,
    # as each component can be developed independently. The Presenter ensures that the View remains passive and
    # focused on UI tasks, while the Model remains unaware of the UI, leading to a more modular and maintainable
    # application structure.

    # Model: Contains the data and the long-running task.
